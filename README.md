# django-blog

I learn Django. Following the tutorials on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNQxxpM1yOs I will create a personal blog. This source consists of 12 YouTube videos. Since the last 2 videos are on how to publish the blog, I worked on the first 10 videos in different branches and after I finis my work I merged them with the master branch.

One can see my main learning sources and my notes in Wiki of this repository. The first version of [Wiki](https://github.com/ciyatg/django-blog/wiki) of this repository is a copy of my Django-Polls-App-and-Git repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/ciyatg/Django-Polls-App-and-Git/wiki).

Note: The tutorial6 branch contains 6th and 7th tutorials. That is why I do not have a tutorial7 branch.
