# django-blog
Creating a personal blog using Django.

In this repository I will create a blog following my second main learning source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNQxxpM1yOs. This source consists of 12 YouTube videos. For each video I will create a branch and after I finish my work with the releted video I will merge that branch to the master branch.

The first version of Wiki of this repository is a copy of my Django-Polls-App-and-Git repository's Wiki.
